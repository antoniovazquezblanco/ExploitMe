ExploitMe
=========

This is a series of vulnerable programs I made for learning something about exploit writting.  
They are separated by topics and ordered in an increasing level of complexity.  


Dependencies
------------

You may need make for building the vulnerable program written in C and a compiler for this language.  
Perl is needed for some exploits.  


Structure
---------

There's a readme file inside each level wich will explain the objetives of the level.  
In the bin folder in every level there are some precompiled binaries for different platforms.  
The sol folder contains the exploit which should include information about the vulnerability.  
There's a folder called src with the source code of the vulnerable program.  
A Makefile is also provided to be used with make. This makefile includes various targets:  
* all: Default target. Compiles the vulnerable program and stores it in the bin folder.  
* debug: Compiles the vulnerable program with debugging info.  
* exploit: Compiles the program and runs exploit.  
* clean: Removes the compiled binary.
